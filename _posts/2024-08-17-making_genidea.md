Learn how I made a visually pleasing ideas generator.
<!--more-->

Hello! I've always wanted to create projects and stuff, but I'm not a creative person. But I thought, why do I need to think the ideas myself? Why can't I build a website that generates ideas for me?

And that's exactly what I did.

## The UI: a text and a button
I started with the UI. I liked the style of JSR's buttons, so I did a little inspect and learned how it was made. After some tweaks, I got something I liked.

![GenIdea Generate! button, styled with brand colors]({{"/assets/images/genidea/button%20normal.png" | relative_url }})

Then the text. Something simple, so I started messing with borders and rings and got something nice.

![GenIdea text, styled with brand colors]({{"/assets/images/genidea/text.png" | relative_url }})

## The colors
My first thought was to use some gradients and things, but I discarded the idea immediately, as it was ugly as hell. Then I remembered I knew about a website, [Huemint](https://huemint.com/), that generates color palettes for you. I gave it a shot and got an amazing, warm palette.

## The actual ideas
Since AI costs money I decided to do a list of nouns like website, app, or platform and another list with things that the user can make. This isn't very creative or random, but I'm looking forward making it even more creative.

### Final

That's it. You can find GenIdea it at [my website](https://notfenixio.is-a.dev/GenIdea/).
